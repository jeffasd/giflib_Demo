/*
 This file contains class object to encode UIImage into GIF file.
 Some notes:
    No Global Color Table, each frame has own one.
    Background color will be unvisible color
    Color resolution are max (8).
    Support only 2 extensions: Graphic Control Extension and Application Extension.
    Color Table has always 256 colors which last color is used as unvisible color,
    that means the GIF file always have unvisible (transparent) pixels.
    The input image will be color quantized to fit 255 colors.
